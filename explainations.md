In this section we explore the data

Plot the stimulus frames 

Plot the dff signal 

# 1 Preprocessing 
- Filter signal -> we are told earlier that it already preprocessed, but we still decide to see if filtering does improve something?
- separate stimuli -> We see that there are white, black and grey pixels. As we know there are neurons that respond only to white pixels (ON-neurons) and neurons that respond to black pixels (OFF neurons). We split the stimuli frames into a white and black one in order to analyse them separately.
