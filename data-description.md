Let's break down what this metadata tells us and how it relates to your task:

Key Observations from the Metadata:
dff.npy (Activity Traces - df/f):

Shape: (189, 105968): This is highly informative. It suggests you have activity traces for 189 neurons (or ROIs) over 105968 time points. This is your primary neural activity data.

Dtype: float32: Standard floating-point precision, good for calcium traces.

max_projection.npy (Maximum Activity Projection):

Shape: (512, 512): This is likely an image, representing the maximum fluorescence intensity across the recording period, projected onto a 2D plane. This can be used for visualizing the field of view.

Dtype: uint16: Unsigned 16-bit integer, common for image pixel values.

roi_masks.npy (ROI Masks for each Cell):

Shape: (189, 512, 512): This is crucial for linking neural activity to spatial location. It indicates you have 189 individual masks, each corresponding to a 512x512 pixel area. These masks define the exact spatial location of each of the 189 neurons from dff.npy within the imaging frame.

Dtype: uint8: Unsigned 8-bit integer, typically used for binary masks (0 for background, 1 or more for ROI pixels) or grayscale images.

running_speed.npy:

Shape: (2, 105968): This suggests two types of running speed data (e.g., instantaneous speed and perhaps a filtered version, or speed in X and Y direction) recorded over the same 105968 time points as the calcium data. Running speed can be a confound or an important covariate in visual cortex activity.

Dtype: float64: High precision for speed measurements.

stim.npy (Stimulus Frames):

Shape: (9000, 16, 28): This implies 9000 individual stimulus frames, each being 16x28 pixels. This is the "locally sparse noise stimulus" you were told about. You'll use these frames to relate neuronal activity to specific visual inputs when fitting tuning functions.

Dtype: uint8: Standard for pixel values in images (0-255).

stim_epoch_table.npy:

Shape: (7, 3): This is a small table with 7 rows and 3 columns.

Dtype: object: This means it contains Python objects, likely strings for stimulus names and numbers for start/end times, confirming the description of it holding ["start", "end", "stimulus"] information. This will be vital for isolating the locally sparse noise epochs and ignoring others.

stim_table.npy:

Shape: (8880, 3): A table with 8880 rows and 3 columns.

Dtype: int64: Confirms it holds integer data. Given the context, this is likely your ["frame", "start", "end"] table, indicating when specific stimulus frames were presented.

t.npy:

Shape: (105968,): A 1D array with 105968 elements.

Dtype: float64: High precision floating-point numbers. This is almost certainly the time vector corresponding to your 105968 time points in the dff.npy and running_speed.npy arrays. This is essential for temporal alignment.

How this Metadata Directly Informs Your Project:
Pre-processing (Step 1):

You know the exact dimensions of your calcium traces (dff), time vector (t), and running speed.

stim_epoch_table is crucial for filtering out non-locally sparse noise stimulus periods from dff, t, and running_speed. You'll need to use the 'stimulus' column to identify the correct epochs.

stim_table will help align the stim frames with the time points in dff.

Spike Inference (Step 2):

You'll be working on dff.npy to infer spikes. The float32 dtype is appropriate. The 189 neurons mean you'll perform this for each neuron.

Tuning Function Fitting (Step 3):

Receptive Field Calculation: You'll relate the inferred spikes (or df/f activity) from dff.npy to the stim.npy data, using stim_table.npy for timing information. The (16, 28) shape of stim.npy is the resolution of your receptive fields.

Spatial Location: The roi_masks.npy are absolutely critical here. Once you've calculated a receptive field for each of the 189 neurons, you'll use the corresponding mask to determine where that neuron is located in the visual cortex.

Statistical Testing / Visual Assessment (Step 4):

With the receptive fields (from stim.npy alignment) and their corresponding spatial locations (roi_masks.npy), you can now map the receptive field properties (e.g., preferred orientation, spatial frequency, or just the x/y center of the RF) onto the physical location of the neuron in the 512x512 image plane.

You can then visualize this: for example, plot the center of each receptive field on top of the max_projection.npy image, perhaps coloring points based on a receptive field property to see if there are spatial clusters or gradients.

This detailed metadata analysis gives you a clear roadmap for each step of your project. You now understand the dimensions and types of your core data components, which is invaluable for planning your code and analysis.
